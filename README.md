                         Branch Description: Nightly Builds / Latest SRC


# notes and future plans

this branch was made to quickly push changes made in my test env, i assume you know the ins and outs of how to use everything here in the repo, so whenever i make changes i will push them here, the standard master/release branch is mainly for a known good build that all works, some debugging here and there is always done that changes things, so to constantly rewrite the readme is a no go, thanks for checking the branch out !

you can ping me in the following server for help.

Future Plans:
- All Controllers supported by default, removes need for configuring passthrough
- Custom Android built from Source, Move away from BlissOS 11.13
- vhost-user-gpu support
- Virtual Machine Manager XML/Import Support for easier managing of usb-passthrough
